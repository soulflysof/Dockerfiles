Welcome to the B2Handle documentation
=====================================

The B2Handle Python module enables interaction with a Handle System server (v8.0 or higher) through a dedicated client class.


.. note:: If you'd like to use the client for reading handles, no user credentials are needed. For creating or modifying handles however, user
    credentials and access to a specific handle server are required.
